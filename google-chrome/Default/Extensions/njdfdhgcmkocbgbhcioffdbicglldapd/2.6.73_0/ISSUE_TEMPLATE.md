## Please read the following points carefully(!). This is not a template or a form. These are just a few tips before you create a ticket. Please delete all text and describe the problem.

* Only Firefox: Does the website work after you activate the HTML filter?

* Is there already an existing issue? (e.g. search for the URL of the website)

* For the most common problems and solutions I have created an online tool. Please test the broken website there: https://www.localcdn.org/test/check

* Check the FAQs: https://codeberg.org/nobody/LocalCDN/wiki

## If none of the above points have helped, then
* Write the URL of the website in the title, for example
* Describe the problem as detailed as possible (maybe one or two screenshots can be helpful)
